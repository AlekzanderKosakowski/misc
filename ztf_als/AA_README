To obtain and save ZTF DR10 light curves, run the "get_ztf10_lc.py" code:

  python3 get_ztf10_lc.py 08:22:39.54 +30:48:57.19
  python3 get_ztf10_lc.py 125.6647 30.8159
  python3 get_ztf10_lc.py target_list.txt

  where "target_list.txt" is a two-column file containing RA in column #1 and Dec in column #2, separated by a space.
  The output light curve will be a 4-column .txt file containing: MHJD MAG MAG_ERR FILTER_CODE
    FILTER_CODE: 1=g, 2=r, 3=i


To run a Lomb Scargle periodogram on a multi-filter, median-combined, ZTF DR10 light curve, run the "ztf_als.py" code:

  python3 ztf_als.py 08:22:39.54 +30:48:57.19
  python3 ztf_als.py 125.6647 30.8159
  python3 get_ztf10_lc.py target_list.txt

  Adjust the minimum/maximum period with the minp/maxp variables in the ztf_als.py code.
  Adjust the number of frequency points with the nfreqs variable in the ztf_als.py code.
  Does not save light curve files by default.
  Only saves images for objects that show "potentially real" variability based on experience.


The output figure for Lomb Scargle uses the Gaia eDR3 CMD of objects with large parallax, "good" astrometry, and low parallax errors.
To create a new Gaia eDR3 CMD for your output images:

  1) Run the get_gaia_edr3_output.py code. Adjust line 71's "index" to match the constraints you want.
       python3 get_gaia_edr3_output.py
     This will create "gaia_edr3_output.txt", which contains the basic Gaia info for plotting with the next code.
  2) Run mk_gaia3_pkl.py
       python3 mk_gaia3_pkl.py
     This will create a pickle file with the Gaia eDR3 CMD plot on the right with three blank lightcurve and FT plots on the left.
     The three blank plots get populated in the "fancy_plot.py" code after the periodogram has been run.

  Most of the final figure output details are assigned in the mk_gaia3_pkl.py code (things such as figsize and subplot spacing etc).
  Since you can't plt.show() on the cluster, consider running the mk_gaia3_pkl.py code on your local machine to make changes to the plot.
